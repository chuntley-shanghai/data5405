    "Data within our programs is inherently **transient**, remembered only long enough to be useful. If not referenced by a variable, data is \"garbage collected\" -- yes, that is the real term -- and forgotten forever. Then, once the program is over, even the variables are forgotten, making way for whatever data the next program needs to do its work. Sometimes that end may be intentional, with the program completing its work, but it can also happen suddenly and without warning when the computer loses power or the system crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is said to be **persistent** if it is recallable after the program that created it ends. Such data exists in **files** located on a secondary storage device like a hard disk or SSD. Files are both useful and somewhat frustrating to deal with. Formats change over time, making some data no longer accessible by modern software. Files get lost as they are transferred from device to device or perhaps we just forget where they are or even that they exist at all. Finally, even if we know where they are and how to find them, getting our software to find and open them is sometimes pretty tricky. \n",

Instead of thinking in terms of files (e.g., MS Word files), we now think in terms of _documents_ (Google Docs, MS Office 365, etc.), page _URLs_ (uniform resource locators), or _APIs_ (application programming interfaces) for data in the Cloud. \n",

    "## **Filesystems and File Paths**\n",
    "In the wild west times of the 1950s and 1960s, every program has its own **filesystem**, a method of storing and retrieving data in files. Standard file formats and operating systems were scarce and software engineers who valued them were scarcer. Every brand of computer and every piece of software had its own way of handling files. So, programmers made up their own standards so that their programs and data could be portable from one computer to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, every filesystem has the following functions:\n",
    "- File creation and deletion\n",
    "- File retrieval and access control\n",
    "- Reading and writing of data \n",
    "\n",
    "File creation, deletion, retrieval, and access control are generally handled by the computer's operating system. In each case the concept of a file as an entity, with a unique identity or location, comes into play. The name and location of a file is called the **file path**. Operating systems logically organize files into hierarchies (trees) of directories (or folders). \n",
    "\n",
    "![File Tree](./img/L7_File_Tree_cropped.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A file path is then a set of navigation instructions to navigate between where the program _resides_ and where the file _resides_ in the hierarchy. Note that we need to know two locations: that of the program (e.g., `myPythonProgram.py`) and that of the file it wants to access (e.g., `data1.txt`, `data2.txt`, `data3.txt`, or `data4.txt`).   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to encode a file path:\n",
    "- **Absolute paths** are used when the program is located _outside_ of the file system. In that case it has to navigate from the **root** of the file hierarchy every time. The path to the `data1.txt` file is then given by `/myFiles/allProjects/myProject/data1.txt`. Each directory in the path is indicated by a slash `/` and a directory name. The first slash in the path then represents the root of the file hierarchy. An absolute path always starts with a slash and the root directory itself is just a single slash `/`.       \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative paths** always start at the location of the current file in the file system. The navigation in this case can be much simpler, especially if the file is located in the same directory as the program. For the program `myPythonProgram.py` we can use the following paths:\n",
    "  - `data1.txt` \n",
    "  - `../MyData/data2.txt`\n",
    "  - `../MyData/data3.txt`\n",
    "  - `../../otherFiles/ExtraData/data4.txt` \n",
    "  \n",
    "  If the file is located in the same directory as the program (the first example), then all we need to supply is the file name. If it is not (the rest), then we use a combination of `..` (go up one directory) and `/directory` (go down into `directory`) instructions followed by the file name. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### **Wait, I thought that `/` was pronounced \"backslash\"**\n",
    "In the early days of PCs, Microsoft and IBM were very wary of copying Unix conventions in their (sort of) new, definitely horrific operating system called PC-DOS. AT&T claimed ownership of Unix at the time, so this worry was not without merit. So, instead of using the slash `/` they used the backslash `\\` as the directory delimiter in file paths. So, anybody who was raised using PCs in the 1980s or perhaps early 1990s, reflexively uses the word \"backslash\" when saying things like web URLs. For the record, web URLs (or file paths in Python) have never used backslashes in this way. Unfortunately, MS Windows (all versions) still uses the backslash for compatibility with PC-DOS, though recent versions of Windows can be coaxed into using the slash as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Python `os` and `os.path` Modules**\n",
    "To work with file paths in an operating system-agnostic (_canonical_) way, Python provides the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) module. More specifically, we can use the [os.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) submodule to create canonical paths and then (if needed) use the `os` module to render the path in an operating-system specific way.

    "## **文件系统和文件路径**\n",
    "在上世纪50年代和60年代的西部拓荒时期，每个程序都有自己的**文件系统**，一种在文件中存储和检索数据的方法。标准文件格式和操作系统很少，而重视它们的软件工程师更少。每一种计算机品牌和每一款软件都有自己处理文件的方式。因此，程序员们制定了自己的标准，使得他们的程序和数据可以在不同计算机之间传输.\n",
    "\n",
    "原则上，每个文件系统都具有以下功能:\n",
    "- 文件创建和删除\n",
    "- 文件检索和访问控制\n",
    "- 数据的读取和写入\n",
    "\n",
    "计算机的操作系统通常负责处理文件的创建、删除、检索和访问权限，在每种情况下，文件都被视为一个独立的概念，有自己的名字和位置。文件的名称和位置被称为**文件路径**。操作系统会把文件按照逻辑关系，像是整理文件夹一样，放在不同的目录里，形成一种树状结构. \n",
    "\n",
    "文件路径就是一组导航指令，用于在程序所在 _位置_ 和文件在层次结构中的 _位置_ 之间进行导航。需要知道两个位置：程序所在位置（例如，`myPythonProgram.py`）和它要访问的文件的位置（例如，`data1.txt` ，`data2.txt` ,`data3.txt` , or  `data4.txt`）.   \n",
    "\n",
    "以下是两种编码文件路径的方式:\n",
    "- **绝对路径**是指当程序位于文件系统 _之外_ 时使用的路径。在这种情况下，它必须每次从文件层次结构的**根**目录导航。`data1.txt` 文件的路径如下：`/myFiles/allProjects/myProject/data1.txt` 。路径中的每个目录都由斜杠 `/` 和目录名表示。路径中的第一个斜杠代表文件层次结构的根。绝对路径始终以斜杠开头，而根目录本身只是一个单独的斜杠 `/`.       \n",
    "\n",
    "- **相对路径**始终从文件系统中当前文件的位置开始。在这种情况下，导航可能会简单得多，特别是如果文件位于与程序相同的目录中。对于程序 `myPythonProgram.py`，我们可以使用以下路径：:\n",
    "  - `data1.txt` \n",
    "  - `../MyData/data2.txt`\n",
    "  - `../MyData/data3.txt`\n",
    "  - `../../otherFiles/ExtraData/data4.txt` \n",
    "  \n",
    "  如果文件位于与程序相同的目录中（第一个例子），那么我们只需要提供文件名即可。如果不是（后面的例子），则我们使用 `..`（向上一级目录） 和 `/directory`（进入 `directory`） 指令的组合，然后加上文件名. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### **等等，我曾经以为 “/” 应该读作“反斜杠”**\n",
    "在PC的早期，微软和IBM对在他们的（某种意义上）新的、令人可怕的操作系统PC-DOS中复制Unix惯例非常谨慎。当时，AT&T声称拥有Unix的所有权，所以这种担忧并非没有道理。因此，他们没有使用斜杠 `/`，而是使用反斜杠 `\\` 作为文件路径中的目录分隔符。因此，任何在20世纪80年代或者早期90年代长大的人，在说类似网络URL的时候会下意识地使用“反斜杠”这个词。值得一提的是，网络URL（或Python中的文件路径）从未以这种方式使用反斜杠。不幸的是，MS Windows（所有版本）仍然使用反斜杠，以保持与PC-DOS的兼容性，尽管最近的Windows版本也可以使用斜杠. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Python的`os`和`os.path`模块**\n",
    "为了以操作系统不可知（_规范的_）方式处理文件路径，Python提供了[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)模块。更具体地说，我们可以使用[os.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) 子模块创建规范路径，然后（如果需要）使用`os`模块将路径呈现为特定于操作系统的方式. "

    "> 2007年，我和家人一起参加了弗吉尼亚大学的一次校友聚会。很开心能见到这么多多年未见的人。很多人在某些方面的成就远超过我。但我和我的妻子在一件事上却表现出色，这是其他人无法比拟的：我们俩共有五个弗吉尼亚大学工程学院的学位。院长感到吃惊，派人去找回了其中三件结实的T恤，以创造一个非正式的记录。我想，下次参加校友聚会时，我会自豪地穿上它.\n",
