    "\n",
    "> \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" -- _The Little Prince_\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts in this lesson actually go all the way back to ancient times, when philosophers studied how they thought about ... thought. Plato, for example, spent significant time on the idea of [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism): the idea that **every entity (physical or conceptual) has an essential form** that defines its substance. That form has **features** consisting of facts that distinguish it from other entities. Entities also have **functions** that they carry out in the world. These essential forms and functions together define **types** or **categories** that are considered eternal, at which point philosophy starts to become theology ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we still use this basic framework to model the world around us, though with slightly different terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data** refers to facts. Each fact has a **value** that captures substance but not importance or meaning. The number 42 can mean lots of things to different people. If you are a Monty Python fan then perhaps you remember it from _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. If you are a baseball fan then 42 could be associated with Mariano Rivera or Jackie Robinson. Or it could just be the answer to \"What's 6 times 9?\" ... ([but only in base 13](https://spooniom.com/6-9-42/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information** refers to facts that have formal **meaning** and **structure**. When associating facts to entities, the facts are given names, kind of like attaching sticky labels, so we know how each fact relates to the entity. For example we can say that 42 is the _uniform number_ (feature) of _Jackie Robinson_ (entity), the famous _baseball player_ (essential type). Data itself can also have a type, just like entities do. Is it 42 or \"42\" or 42.0? It matters a lot, at least to a data scientist. However, it's hard to tell without knowing how it is to be interpreted. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge** refers to functionality: the ability to use information to do things. A knowledgeable person can do a lot of things, once they have the necessary information. A less knowledgeable person might not be able to do anything useful, even when given perfect information. In Python, **the programs that we write are knowledge.** They are how we get the computer to do what we want it to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, each of these things builds on the ones before it. We could of course continue on to **wisdom** (knowing what to do at a given time) and **virtue** (knowing right vs wrong), but then we'd be getting into theology again instead of science.\n",
    "\n",

    "> \"本质的东西用眼睛是看不见的。\" -- _小王子_\n",
    "\n",
    "本课中的概念可以追溯到古代，当时哲学家们研究了他们对思维的看法。例如，柏拉图花了大量时间思考[本质主义](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism)的概念：即每个实体（无论是物质世界的还是精神世界的）都有一个定义其实质的本质形式。这种形式具有由事实构成的特征，这些特征将其与其他实体区分开来。实体还具有在世界上执行的功能。这些本质形式和功能共同定义了被认为是永恒的类型或范畴，此时哲学开始变成神学……\n",
    "\n",
    "今天，我们仍在使用这一基本框架来描绘周围的世界，只是术语略有不同：\n",
    "\n",
    "- **数据** 数据即事实。每个事实都有一个值，捕捉了实质，但自身不具备重要性或含义。例如，数字42的意义因人而异。如果你是Monty Python的粉丝，42就是《银河系漫游指南》中生命、宇宙以及一些事情的中级答案。如果你是棒球迷，那么42就是42号球手Mariano Rivera或Jackie Robinson。或者，它可能只是“6乘以9等于多少”的答案......（[但仅限于13进制](https://spooniom.com/6-9-42/))。\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **信息** 信息指的是具有正式含义和结构的事实。当将事实与实体相关联时，这些事实被赋予名称，类似于贴上标签，以便我们知道每个事实与实体的关系。例如，我们可以说42是著名棒球选手Jackie Robinson（实体）的球衣号码（事实，基本类型）。就像实体一样，数据本身也可以有类型。42、\"42\" 和42.0是截然不同的，至少在数据科学家眼中是如此。在不知道数据类型的情况下很难对其做出解读。\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **知识** 知识指的是功能：利用信息做事的能力。知识渊博的人一旦掌握了必要的信息，就能做很多事情。而知识较少的人，即使获得了完美的信息，也可能做不了任何有用的事情。在Python中，我们编写的程序就是知识。程序就是我们让计算机按要求做事的方法。\n",
    " \n",
    "你可能已经注意到，上述每一项都是在前一项的基础上建立的。当然，我们还可以继续讲解**智慧**（知道在特定的时间该做什么）和**美德**（知道对与错），但这样我们就又要进入神学范畴、远离科学了。"

    "So far we have only seen a few kinds of statements. The examples so far have been mostly assignment statements, which _always_ follow the same pattern: _`variable = expression`_.

    "**An expression is anything that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions _are_ things.** So, each calculation like `1+1` or `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an expression, but so is recalling the value of a variable like `first_name` or `last_name`. They each produce a value when evaluated. Expressions can be composed of other expressions. In order to evaluate them Python will break them down into smaller and smaller expressions, until all that's left is some combination of variables, operators, and **literal** values. **Literals** are things like numbers or text strings that don't need to be broken down any further. \n",

    "**表达式是任何可以求值的东西。表达式就是事物。** 因此，每次计算，如`1+1`或 `first_name + \" \" + last_name`都是一个表达式。而调用变量值，如`first_name`或`last_name`也是表达式。它们在求值时都会产生一个值。表达式可以由其他表达式组成。为了求值，Python会将它们分解成更小的表达式，直到只剩下变量、运算符和**字面**值的组合。**字面**值是像数字或文本字符串这样不需要进一步分解的东西。\n",
    "\n",
    "**An operator represents a calculation with a symbol like `+` or `%`.** In order for operators to be useful they have to be applied to one or more **operands** according to a specific pattern. So, for example, the `+` operator follows this pattern: _`expression1 + expression2`_, where the operands are `expression1` and `expression2`.  In principle, an operator can have any number of operands: unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, ternary operators have three, etc. However, all of Python's built-in operators are binary, with one operand on the left and another on the right. \n",

    "**运算符用 `+` 或 `%` 这样的符号表示计算。** 它们必须按照特定模式应用于一或多个运算对象才能发挥作用。   例如，运算符+遵循以下模式：_`expression1 + expression2`_，其中运算对象为`expression1`和  `expression2`。原则上，运算符可以有任意数量的运算对象：一元运算符有一个运算对象数，二元运算符有两个运算对象，三元运算符有三个运算对象，以此类推。然而，Python的所有内置运算符都是二元的，一个运算对象在左边，另一个在右边。\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply an operator to a set of operands we call it an **operation**. Since operations always produce a value, they are also expressions and can also be broken down into smaller and smaller parts. When doing so we need to know which operations to evaluate first. For that we can use the same [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) you likely learned in middle school. Operations are evaluated **left to right** _except_ ...\n",

    "> ABOUT GOOGLE CLASSROOM AND PRICELINE    \n",
    "> In 2014 I was approached by an alum to round up students to test a new app called Google Classroom, which was in private beta (with an NDA). I said I would be glad to get some of my classes to try it out _very quietly_ if the development team paid us a visit at the end of the semester. They came, asked and answered lots of questions, and left me with a monster box of these tee shirts in black and green. I gave away what I could but kept this one black tee as a souvenir. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">This was not the first time we had a top secret beta test at Fairfield. In my first year I was approached by an alum about this new service being developed at Walker Digital. It was, of course, Priceline. Fairfield students were used as focus groups, including the one that picked William Shatner as the spokeperson. It was entirely based on his voice (for radio ads). Shatner beat out Hellen Mirren and a couple others with distinctive voices. After that we also got juicy details from the first couple years of website development. Lots of things broke back then -- it wasn't until version 3 that they could actually issue electronic tickets without having to print and snail mail them to you -- and I am always a sucker for a good war story.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ## 一件T恤，一个故事\n",
    "> 关于谷歌课堂和Priceline\n",
    "> 2014年，一位校友找到我，希望我召集学生来测试一款名为“谷歌课堂”的新应用程序，该应用当时正处于内测阶段（有保密协议）。我说，如果开发团队在期末过来找我们，我很乐意让一些班级悄悄试用一下。开发团队如约而至，问了很多问题，也回答了很多问题，然后给我留下一大箱黑色和绿色的T恤。我尽可能将T恤都发了出去，但留下了一件黑色T恤作为纪念。\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 这已经不是我们第一次在费尔菲尔德大学进行绝密测试了。在我工作的第一年，一位校友向我介绍了Walker Digital正在开发的新服务，当然就是Priceline。费尔菲尔德的学生形成焦点小组，其中一个小组甚至选择William Shatner作为代言人，因为他的声音很适合广播广告。Shatner击败了Hellen Mirren和其他几位具有独特声音的人。之后，我们还从网站开发的最初几年中获得了许多有趣的细节。那个时候网站问题很多，直到第三个版本才实现电子开票，而不必打印后邮寄。我很喜欢听这类技术或商业项目中各种困难和挑战的故事。\n",
