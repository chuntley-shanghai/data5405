Generally, top comments are preferred for complex logic. \n",

What were the requirements (in your own words)? What approach did you take?

Even if there were, they would not have the place-value system needed to multiply numbers with 2 or more digits. Instead, Egyptian multiplication relied on basic sums like 3 x 2 = 2 + 2 + 2. This worked fine for small products but could be very tedious and error-prone for larger products like 1259 x 258, which could take days to add 258 to itself 1258 times.  So, they came up with an ingenious shortcut that saved lots of time and error. \n",

    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Egyptian multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication) is very similar to so-called Russian Peasant multiplication. You may find the Russian Peasant version slightly easier to understand. \n",
    "- You *can* generate `powers_of_two` with a list comprehension but it may be easier to do it with a while loop. To be most efficient, it may make sense to generate `multiples_of_y` in the same loop. \n",
    "- Step 4 is a variation of the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). You are trying to find the largest subset of the items (numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) that will fit (sum) inside the knapsack ($x$). The trick with most knapsack problems is to take a so-called \"greedy\" approach, where we try inserting items from biggest to smallest; with each item we insert, we have to adjust the remaining space in the knapsack to account. The logic is something like this:\n",
    "    1. Sort the items from largest to smallest. \n",
    "    2. Insert the biggest item that will fit into the knapsack. \n",
    "    3. Account for the space remaining the knapsack after intersion. \n",
    "    4. Repeat 2 & 3 until the knapsack is filled. \n",
    "\n",
    "  In this case, you can exactly fill the knapsack with a single pass through the items. In other words, you only need to try each item once *as long as you start with the biggest ones first*. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Note: it hard to get more specific than that without writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To be sure the output string is formatted consistently consider using \n",
    "  - `\" + \".join()` to string together the terms from step 4.\n",
    "  - an f-string with placeholders for $x$, $y$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to complete this code in 14 lines of code (excluding comments). However, 20-25 lines is more realistic. "

    "### 提示\n",
    "- 埃及乘法[Egyptian multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication)与所谓的俄罗斯农民乘法（Russian Peasant multiplication）非常相似。您可能会觉得俄罗斯农民的版本稍微容易理解一些.\n",
    "- *您可以使用*列表推导式生`成powers_of_two`，但使用while循环来执行程序可能更容易。在同一个循环中生成`multiples_of_y`最为高效.\n",
    "- 第4步是背包问题[knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)的一种变体. 您正在尝试寻找能够装入(求和)背包($x$)的最大子集合(数字 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)。大多数背包问题的技巧是采用所谓的“贪婪”技法，即尝试插入从最大到最小的元素；每插入一个元素，都需要调整背包中剩余的空间来适应。其逻辑大致如下:\n",
    "  1. 将元素从大到小排序.\n",
    "  2. 插入能够适合背包的最大元素.\n",
    "  3. 考虑插入后背包中的剩余空间.\n",
    "  4. 重复步骤2和3，直至填满背包.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  在这种情况下，可以执行一次遍历元组来填满背包。亦即，*只要从最大的元素值开始*，每个元素值就只需要尝试一次.\n",
    "\n",
    "  注意：除非编写代码，否则很难给出更具体的信息.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 为确保输出字符串格式一致\n",
    "  - 请考虑使用`\" + \".join()`来连接第4步的项.\n",
