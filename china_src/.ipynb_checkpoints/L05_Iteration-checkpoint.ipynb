    ">\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.\" -- Phil Karlton\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting is one of the first math skills we learn. By the age of 18 months, a child can usually carry out the basic steps of marking off the next item on a list. They might get confused by the sixth or seventh item -- perhaps counting the same item twice -- but **a toddler can usually count up to 5 items.** It's not like the process is that hard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an item from the pile.\n",
    "2. Mark off the item by saying the next number in the sequence. \n",
    "3. Place the item into another pile. \n",
    "4. Repeat 1-3 until there are no items left in the original pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is surprising how hard some novice programmers find it to **iterate** (mark off) items one at time. Given a list (or other sequence) of items to be processed exactly the same way, they will try to use what we call \"copy / paste / edit\" logic, modifying the code a little for the specifics of each item. Wow, what a complete waste of time. Instead, they should do exactly like the babies do: \n",
    "1. Take an item (it) off the list.\n",
    "2. Process it, taking note of any effects.\n",
    "3. If needed again, add it to an out-list of processed items.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the list is exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being more efficient for the programmer, it is also less buggy. The logic in step 2 is always the same, no matter how many times we repeat the loop. Why make things more difficult by doing it a different way each time?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Heads Up** Step 2 has *side effects* that may affect data. There are two ways that can happen. Either **it alters the data values in place** (variable reassignment) or **it generates new values**, usually to be stored in a list or other collection. We'll see both in the long division example below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This lesson is about iteration, the last of the four fundamental elements of Structured Programming.** By the end of this lesson you will know the basics of all programming logic. Everything else is somewhat derivative, as Edsger Dijkstra proved so many years ago. "

    "## **More than Just Counting: How about Long Division?**\n",
    "While counting may be the first iterative process we learn as children, it is far from the last. Another is **long division**, which children used to master as a right of passage in primary school, but today is (sadly) not seen as an educational necessity. Instead, children are told to use a calculator. While somewhat practical in an age when everybody has phones in their pockets, children are being cheated out of an important lesson in algorithmic thinking needed for higher forms of math like algebra and calculus. The effects are obvious to those of us who teach quantitative sciences for a living. Many young adults today cannot reliably calculate an average of ten numbers, **even when armed with a calculator to do the arithmetic**. Instead they rely on tools like MS Excel that turn averaging into a feature instead of a process, which over time leads to a lack of intuitive understanding of important analytical concepts like centrality and variability. They see the world as static, with all the processing already done, all the data already processed, when real world data is anything but static.  And it all starts (or, more properly, ends for many people) with long division. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have established its importance, what exactly is long division? Long division is a standard manual method for dividing one number (the **dividend**) by another (the **divisor**). The result is called the **quotient**, which may include a **remainder** if the first number cannot be evenly divided by the second. Like counting, it involves repetition of a fixed set of steps (with examples shown for the first pass; you may also want to try this with pencil and paper): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the `dividend` and the `divisor`. For our purposes the dividend is treated as a string of digits that we can \"pull down\" (or, as we programmers call it, \"pop off\") one at a time starting from the left hand side. Similarly, we will build up the quotient one digit at a time by comparing the divisor with digits from the dividend. \n",
    "  * Set `dividend` = 1260257, `divisor` = 37, `quotient` = 0, `remainder` = 0.\n",
    "2. Pull down a digit `d` from the dividend and add it to the `remainder`.\n",
    "  * Set `remainder = 10 * 0 + d = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n",
    "3. Calculate a digit `q` by evenly dividing the `remainder` by the `divisor`, ignoring the non-integer fraction left over. (In Python we use the `//` operator for this sort of integer division.)\n",
    "  * Set `q = remainder // divisor = 1 // 37 = 0`; the first digit of the quotient is `0`. \n",
    "4. Calculate the `product` of `q` and the `divisor`.\n",
    "  * Set `product = q * divisor = 0`\n",
    "5. Subtract the `product` from the `remainder` and append the digit `q` to the `quotient`. \n",
    "  * The new `remainder` is (the previous) `remainder` - `product` or `1 - 0 = 1`.\n",
    "  * The new `quotient` is calculated as `quotient * 10 + q = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0`.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until no digits remain to pull down from the `dividend`.   \n",

    "- Unless you know what you are doing, **make sure that the boolean expression eventually evaluates to False.** That means that something has to happen inside the body of the loop to cause the value of the expression to change.\n",
    "- Most of the time you will need to **initialize a variable (i.e., assign it a value)** used in your boolean expression so that it evaluates to True the first time. That same variable (often what is called an _accumulator_) will likely need to be updated with each pass of the loop. Often we do that at the end of the loop body. \n",
    "- **Just as with `if` statements, don't forget the colons.** They are needed by Python to know where the boolean expression ends.\n",
    "- **We can create infinite loops by short-circuiting the boolean expression** (e.g., `while True: ...`). Then it is up to the loop body to terminate the loop using a `break` statement, which works similarly to a function `return` except for loops. **Anytime that Python encounters a `break` it terminates the enclosing loop.**\n",
    "- We can short-circuit the loop body itself by using a `continue` statement to return to the top of the loop immediately, without executing the rest of the loop. This can make some things much, much faster.  \n",

    "### **The Accumulator Pattern: Iteration as a General Design Principle**\n",
    "In any profession there eventually develops a kind of shorthand language that everybody uses that others outside the profession find totally baffling. In programming we call these shorthand terms **[design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), defined as \"standard problems with standard solutions\"**. Need to do A? Then try solutions X, Y, and Z. X, Y or X may involve thousands of lines of code but all we need to do is refer to them by their names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration itself is not a design pattern. It is not a problem, after all. Instead, it represents an entire class of solutions to wide variety of programming problems.  Quite simply, any problem that involves acting on a set of things is likely to involve an iteration-based solution. The name we use for these sorts of problems is the **Accumulator Pattern**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Py4E textbook uses the term _accumulator_ for variables like `count` or `total` that are updated inside loops. Accumulators act as a kind of process memory, building up (accumulating) a record of what has happened so far. Another accumulator was the `quotient` in our long division codes. We built it up one digit at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these sorts of accumulators are great for introducing the concept, they are but the simplest examples of a much broader set of possibilities. We can, for example, accumulate transaction records at an ATM, or grades in a course, or ... well, just about anything that requires a precise record of past _iterations_ of a process. A database accumulates data and makes it persistent. A CSV file accumulates records with each row that is added. A machine learning model accumulates accuracy statistics with each test instance. In each case, the pattern is the same: accumulation of artifacts from iterating over a set of items. And now we know how to handle each of these cases in our code. "

    "任何行业中最终都会发展出一种大家都使用但外行人完全不懂的简化语言。在编程中，我们称这些简化术语为设计模式 （https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern），**即“标准问题的标准解决方案”**。想要完成A？那么尝试解决方案X、Y和Z。虽然X、Y或Z可能涉及数千行代码，但我们只需用它们的名称来引用它们即可. \n",

    "Py4E课本用累加器这个术语来表示在循环内部更新的变量，如计数（`count`）或加和（`total`）。累加器充当了一种进程存储器，逐渐搭建起（累加）迄今为止发生的事情的记录。另一个累加器是我们长除法代码中的商（`quotient`）。我们将其一位数字、一位数字地搭建起来. \n",
    "\n",
    "上述累加器有助于帮助理解这个概念，但它们只是无数种累加器中最简单的几个例子。例如，我们可以累加ATM交易记录、课程成绩……以及所有需要精确记录某过程之前曾有过的 _迭代_ 的东西。数据库累加数据并永久保存它。CSV文件每添加一行都会累加记录。机器学习模型在每个测试实例中累加准确率统计信息。在每种情况下，模式都是一样的：通过迭代过程中累加数据来解决问题。现在我们已经了解了如何在代码中处理每一种情况了. "

Before 1995, it was called ORSA/TIMS, not the most catchy of names, we'd all agree. Besides shedding the awkward name, the _other_ reason for the name change was to avoid TIMS (The Institute for Manage Science) being confused with the Decision Science Institute, which had recently had to change _its_ name from AIDS. (Yes, really.) As you can tell, math geeks are not marketing wizzes. Even the INFORMS name is kind of confusing. People think it's about IT, not really hard math and data science.  \n",
